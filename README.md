### RESEARCH QUESTION

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

### Metrics Of Success

Perform Univariate and bivariate analysis and give insights based on the findings. 

### Context 
In the recent past there has been an increase in the number of online click ads. This is because website owners and bloggers have realised that they could actually make money from the number of clicks on the ads they choose to advertise on their websites. 

It is therefore necessary to create content that would be a target audience's preferance in order to get them to their website(blog) and hopefully get them to click on the ads displayed. 

### Experimental Design

1. Load the dataset
2. Explore the data i.e. find information and summaries of all the columns 
3. Clean the data i.e. check and deal with missing data, duplicates and outliers in the dataset
4. Perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis. 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations
